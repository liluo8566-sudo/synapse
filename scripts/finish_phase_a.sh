# finish_phase_a.sh — 30-second one-shot to close the last Phase A exit clause.
#
# Run from the synapse-wx repo root after Lumi wakes:
#   cd /Users/Gabrielle/CC-Lab/synapse-wx
#   ./scripts/finish_phase_a.sh
#
# Steps it does FOR you:
#   1. Stop the old weclaude launchd bridge (so iLink stops dual-polling).
#   2. Open ILinkClient.login() — prints QR; you scan once on your phone.
#   3. After login completes, sync the new token to ~/.config/synapse-wx/.
#   4. Run scripts/install_launchd.sh to load synapse-wx LaunchAgent.
#   5. Tail the out.log so you can watch the first contact land.
#
# After step 2 finishes you can put the phone down — steps 3-5 are unattended.
