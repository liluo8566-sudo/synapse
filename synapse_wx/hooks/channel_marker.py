"""UserPromptSubmit hook: tag every prompt with the current channel.

Always emits `[channel: <name>]` so Stellan knows which surface Lumi is on.
Default channel is `cli` when `MARROW_CHANNEL` is unset (bridges set their
own value before spawning cc; the cli has no env, so it falls back to cli).

When the same sid was last seen on a different channel, emits
`[channel: <current> <- <previous>]` so a cross-channel switch is visible
on the very next prompt. The detection reads `last_active.json` (the
shared cross-channel pointer) and matches sid; no time gate, since the
sid match itself is the strong signal.

The hook also writes `last_active.json` on each prompt so the next channel
that picks up this sid can detect the switch in turn. Bridge loops also
write at turn-end; the writes are idempotent and atomic, so the redundancy
is harmless.
