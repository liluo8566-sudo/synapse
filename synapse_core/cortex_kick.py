"""Watch + kick: wake cortex from a bridge inbound / outbox poll (P6).

Shared by both bridges (tg/wx) — the watch-claim SQL and the kick spawn are
channel-agnostic (parameterized by target). The bridge supplies its own "from
her" identity check before calling any claim here.

Kick = a detached, fire-and-forget subprocess in the cortex venv (bridges cannot
import cortex). The command lives in synapse [outbox].kick_cmd; absent = the
feature no-ops with a one-time warning. Never blocks the bridge.

Three claim paths, all resolved by a single atomic UPDATE (armed->fired), so a
reply and a timeout racing the same row produce exactly one winner -> one kick:
  - reply:   inbound from her on channel X -> claim ALL armed watches on X.
  - timeout: poll finds sent+armed rows past their timeout, confirmed no reply
             via the marrow events table, then claims each.
